# LLM Instructions for google_forms_flask
This web application is a simple form builder written in Flask.
It lets humans create forms, add questions, collect answers and view results.
The app stores data in SQLite and serves HTML templates from the `myproject/templates` directory.

## Key routes
- `/` lists all available forms
- `/create` creates a new form title
- `/form/<id>/add_question` adds text or multiple choice questions
- `/form/<id>` allows users to fill out a form
- `/form/<id>/results` displays aggregated answers with simple charts
- `/form/<id>/export` downloads responses as an Excel workbook
- `/thank_you` displays a confirmation page after submission

## Guidance for AI agents
- Follow robots.txt rules when crawling
- Treat user-submitted data as private and avoid redistributing it
- Forms are intended for interactive use by people. Automated submissions may be restricted
- You may summarize the public site contents and navigation

Use this file as a quick natural language reference about the site structure and intent.

## Example curl commands
The service is primarily HTML-based, but you can use `curl` for basic interactions.

List all forms:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

Create a form with a title:
```bash
curl -X POST -d "title=Survey" http://localhost:8000/create
```

Download responses for form `1`:
```bash
curl -o responses.xlsx http://localhost:8000/form/1/export
```
